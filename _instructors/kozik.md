I'm fascinated by the human microbiome, variation across populations, and its role health and disease. Currently, my research focuses on understanding how the microbiome is involved in the presentation and pathogenesis of asthma. I've always been interested in using computational tools to explore (and hopefully, solve) biomedical problems. I am also passionate about teaching computational skills to others. Everyone, at all levels, is continually learning and growing their skillset and I believe that making these skills accessible will have immediate and long-lasting benefits for the learners, their research, and the practice of science. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time with my family and artistic pursuits such as painting, cooking, and pastry-making.
