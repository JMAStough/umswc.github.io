I study the relationship between gut microbes and longevity in mice.
Much of my work is at the intersection of bioinformatics, ecology, and
statistics.
I teach computational skills to my colleagues because I want to live in a world
where we can easily share data and analyses between scientists, between labs,
and between disciplines.
