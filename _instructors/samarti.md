In a previous life, I studied genetics and worked at a lab bench in a major pharmaceutical company. Then I switched careers and went to library school. My current position as the Biological Sciences Librarian at the University of Michigan Library allows me to bring my research experience and understanding of the field to bear on my librarianship. While my job doesn't involve much programming at present, working with the U-M Carpentries group gives me an opportunity to flex my teaching muscles, and helps me keep up-to-date with the analytical skills that my researchers need.

During my off hours, I can be found reading in my house in the forest or on the dance floor at a Detroit techno show.
