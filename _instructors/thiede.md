I'm a biomedical engineer pursuing a PhD in Microbiology & Immunology. I was first exposed to programming in my undergraduate training — and I distinctly remember the prospect of learning to code to be intimidating. Now, I program regularly (mostly in R) to study transmission and evolution of MRSA through a combination of genomics and epidemiology. Through instructing with [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) and Software Carpentry, I hope to make learning to code fun, exciting, and less intimidating. 

You’ll find me outside of lab hanging out with my beloved cats, doing zumba, listening to science and comedy podcasts, or attending a concert.
