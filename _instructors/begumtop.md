I use computational approaches and sequencing technology to study the human microbiome. My current research centers on using machine learning to detect colorectal cancer by using microbiota-associated biomarkers.

I took a Software Carpentry workshop as a first year graduate student in 2012 where I learned about UNIX, R and Git for the first time. Fast forward to 2018, as a postdoctoral fellow who uses computational tools every day, I became an SWC instructor to teach UNIX, R and Git. My story shows that everyone can code, given the opportunity.
