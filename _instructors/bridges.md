My team wants to understand the molecular networks that lie at the intersection between metabolism and health. I did my undergraduate and doctoral training in Biochemistry at the University of Calgary, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada followed by a fellowship with Dr. Alan Saltiel at the University of Michigan. During that time we used several model systems including yeast, flies and mice to elucidate a variety of novel aspects of metabolic regulation. My team studies the molecular, cellular and physiological changes associated with obesity. We are particularly interested in the role of the central nutrient responsive protein kinase mTORC1, how it is altered in weight gain and how its activation affects obesity related co-morbidities. With a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity, we hope to better prevent and treat obesity in the future.
